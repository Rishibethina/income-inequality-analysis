A Multi-Year Analysis of How Price Increases in Essential Goods Alter Spending Behavior Across U.S. Income Groups (2010–2022)
Project Overview
This project analyzes how inflation in essential goods—such as utilities, housing, and food—affects household spending patterns across different income groups in the United States. Using Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) microdata from 2010 to 2022, the goal is to quantify the impact of rising prices on consumer behavior and highlight the disproportionate burden faced by low-income households.
Key Finding
Each $100 increase in utility costs is associated with a significantly greater reduction in discretionary spending for low-income households compared to higher-income groups.
Data Sources
Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
Specifically, the Interview public-use microdata (PUMD) files from 2010–2022
In this stage, the utc16 file from 2016 is used, containing detailed utility spending records
